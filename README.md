###### @ INIT THE `MATVERSE`: A MULTIVERSED EXTENSION TO THE `MATLABPATH`

```
First day: there's a way to enter and a way to leave, the sacred path
           can be populated with the countless galaxies of the matverse
           and then restored, again untouched as nothing ever happened.

For now the alternate-universe exist and it's unique, amounting to a
curated collection of scripts. They are mostly unrelated and do many
things, from fine-tuning plots to looking for strings.
```

###### @ A NEW HOPE: `EXPORT_FIG`, THE CELEBRATED WRAPPER THAT FIXES `PRINT`

```
Second day: a new verse arrives, as a git submodule, it's the mighty
            export_fig, a holy wrapper for the infamously broken print
            function, whose insanely erratic behavior has plagued most
            matlabians since ever... eventually our figures find peace.

The first submodule arrived, bringing a whole new world of delightfully
printed pictures, after all the misery of the ancient era. Glory to the
wrapper and to the writer, so well-versed in the matlabic arts that even
masters the /undocumented/. Also a bizarre creature of theirs, then has 
taken the big leap leading into the scriptverse all the magic of cprintf!
