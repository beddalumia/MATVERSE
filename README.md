###### @ INIT THE `MATVERSE`: A MULTIVERSED EXTENSION TO THE `MATLABPATH`

```
First day: there's a way to enter and a way to leave, the sacred path
           can be populated with the countless galaxies of the matverse
           and then restored, again untouched as nothing ever happened.

For now the alternate-universe exist and it's unique, amounting to a
curated collection of scripts. They are mostly unrelated and do many
things, from fine-tuning plots to looking for strings.

> The heroes of the first day are @chadagreene and @msecli.
